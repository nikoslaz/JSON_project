# JSON_project

Creating a Language for JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
This project focuses on the development of a domain-specific language (DSL) for defining and managing JSON data. The created language, JSONLang, is compiled into valid C++ code using macros, operator overloading, and modern C++ features. JSONLang simplifies working with JSON-like structures directly within a custom-defined syntax.

To compile:
    -mkdir build
    -cd build
    -cmake ..
    -make
    -make run
